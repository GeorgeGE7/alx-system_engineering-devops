# Postmortem: April 8, 2024 Outage

## Issue Summary:
- **Duration:** April 8, 2024, 10:00 AM - April 8, 2024, 2:00 PM (GMT)
- **Impact:** A significant portion of our users experienced intermittent connectivity issues, resulting in a 30% increase in error rates across our platform.
- **Root Cause:** The outage was caused by a misconfiguration in our load balancer settings, leading to uneven distribution of traffic and subsequent service degradation.

## Timeline:
- **10:00 AM:** Issue detected through automated monitoring alerts indicating increased error rates.
- **10:05 AM:** Engineering team notified of the issue.
- **10:15 AM:** Initial investigation focused on backend services for possible performance bottlenecks.
- **10:30 AM:** Assumed root cause to be database latency issues due to recent deployment.
- **11:00 AM:** Database team engaged to investigate potential database issues.
- **11:30 AM:** Database team confirmed no abnormalities in database performance.
- **12:00 PM:** Investigation shifted towards network infrastructure, suspecting network congestion.
- **12:30 PM:** Network team examined network logs and ruled out network congestion.
- **1:00 PM:** Load balancer configuration reviewed, identifying misconfigured settings.
- **1:30 PM:** Incident escalated to senior engineering management for immediate resolution.
- **2:00 PM:** Load balancer settings corrected, restoring normal service functionality.

## Root Cause and Resolution:
- **Root Cause:** The misconfiguration in load balancer settings led to uneven distribution of traffic, causing performance degradation.
- **Resolution:** Load balancer settings were corrected to evenly distribute traffic among backend servers, resolving the connectivity issues.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:
- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Regular audits of load balancer configurations to prevent similar misconfigurations.
  - Enhanced monitoring of load balancer performance metrics to detect anomalies promptly.
  - Implement automated testing of load balancer configurations before deployment to production.
- **Tasks to Address the Issue:**
  - Schedule a post-incident review with the engineering team to analyze the root cause and identify areas for improvement.
  - Develop a playbook for load balancer configuration checks and audits.
  - Implement automated alerts for load balancer configuration changes to ensure immediate detection of misconfigurations.
  
## Conclusion:
The April 8, 2024, outage was a result of a misconfigured load balancer, leading to intermittent connectivity issues for a significant portion of our users. Through a systematic investigation and corrective measures, we were able to identify and resolve the root cause promptly. Moving forward, we will implement stricter controls and enhanced monitoring to prevent similar incidents in the future.
